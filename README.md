Application exercises from applying at State Farm

State-Farm
State Farm interview exercises from January and July 2019
These files are two interview exercises given to me by State Farm during the job application process. I wanted to share them because it shows my progress in 2019, from when I did my first interview exercise in January to my second in July. I've learned a lot in that time, and I think it shows.

The instructions were basically to take a dataset they provided, perform two supervised classification models, and provide the results and code to be scored. Other than that, it was up to me.
